        <p>Sonic.EXE: Outcome Memories, or just <strong>OM</strong> for short, is an asymettrical horror game released in August 2025. It currently is in early development with it's first big update around the corner. It features Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Dr. Eggman, Metal Sonic and Cream up against a supposed god that goes by X, a "faker" of Sonic, taking upon his looks. In an infinite time loop, <b>the fun never ends.</b></p>
        <h2>Why I Got into Outcome Memories</h2>
        <p>I was supporting it before release, and when it came out I joined the second. I told my friends and they seemed interested, in which I didn't think they would. We all enjoyed the playstyle, even though some people are annoying to play against. I stuck to Knuckles <em>immediately</em>, with his close-range kit. I also enjoyed playing Metal Sonic and Amy.</p>

        <p>All you need to play this game is a ROBLOX account and an idea on how to use your character.</p>

        <h1><strong>THE LORE</strong></h1>
        <p>The lore has vessels that are trapped inside of the bodies of Sonic's friends. They are all pulled from different worlds, or different states of time, forced to play a twisted game of cat and mouse inside corrupted places they once visited along with corrupted versions of their friends, time and time again.</p>
